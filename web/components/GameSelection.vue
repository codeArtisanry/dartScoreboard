            <b>How to play target score darts?</b>
           
               <p>There are three types in target score game 
                <ul>
                    <li>101</li>
                    <li>301</li>
                    <li>501</li>
                </ul>
               After starting game first you want to select one from this
                If you are choosing 101 then To play 101 darts the rules are simple,
                    both players or teams start with a score of 101 points. 
                    Each player then takes alternating turns at throwing their darts at the dartboard.
                    The points scored are removed from the total, and then the opposing player/team does the same. 
                    The first to reach zero wins the game.
               For 301 and 501 rules are same but you want to start with 301 or 501 Score
